You build workflows using nodes—triggers, actions, and transforms—and run them self-hosted or on n8n Cloud.\n\nRecently, I had to automate a product ops workflow: pull a product catalog, categorise items, surface close alternatives, and sync the results downstream. I used n8n as my automation engine and Neon as the database to handle deduping, versioning, and categorizing so the workflow could make smarter decisions over time.\n\nn8n provides official nodes for popular services like Slack, Google Sheets, and GitHub, but the real strength shows up in the community. Developers step in to cover the integrations the core team might never build. For example, Minhlucvan's Apify node brings web scraping workflows into n8n, Yatolstoy's Kommo node connects to a well-known CRM, and Mohsen Hadianfard's ApplyBoard node helps education agents sync student applications. These are polished, ready-to-use integrations built by third-party developers and published on the npm registry.\n\nHere's where things got interesting. At first, I used n8n's official Postgres node to connect to my Neon database, but it quickly felt limiting. Neon is a modern, serverless Postgres built for speed, scale, and branching, yet the generic Postgres node couldn't access features like branch switching. If I wanted to get the most out of Neon inside my workflows, I needed something else. That's when I decided to build a custom Neon node for n8n.\n\nThe goal was to make something that works, and also build it in a way that followed n8n's conventions, handled database operations securely (avoiding SQL injection), and matched the quality bar of community nodes. The node needed to feel native to both n8n and Neon.\n\nThe scope became clear:\n\n- Execute custom queries\n- Standard CRUD (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)\n- Support Neon's branch switching via the n8n UI\n- Follow n8n resources on building custom nodes\n\nWith this scope in mind, I also had to decide which type of node architecture to use. n8n supports two approaches: **programmatic nodes** (trigger nodes) and **declarative nodes** (JSON-based syntax nodes). Given my goals, declarative was the obvious choice. It would keep the node maintainable and aligned with community standards.\n\n## Setting up My Custom Neon Node\n\nBefore setting up my environment, the first thing I had to do was get familiar with how n8n nodes are actually built.\n\n👉 **Before diving in**\n\nIf you're thinking, maybe \"I'll try building a node myself\" here's what I had to get in place to get my environment running:\n\n- **Node.js + npm** → the bread and butter of building custom nodes\n- **TypeScript** → because n8n speaks TS, not plain JS\n- **Docker + Docker Compose** → easiest way to spin up n8n locally without headaches\n- **Some JS/TS + Docker knowledge** → nothing advanced, but enough to not get stuck on the basics.\n\nOnce I had this stack ready, it was smooth sailing to clone n8n's starter template and strip it down for my own Neon node. 🚀\n\nNothing fancy yet, but at this point, only three essentials are really needed to get a custom node running:\n\n1. The **node JSON file**\n2. The **node TypeScript file**\n3. The **credentials file**\n\nThat's the bare minimum foundation.\n\n### Structuring the Node\n\nThe n8n's official **resource on building custom nodes** already lays down the patterns people expect from database integrations, so sticking close to that gave my Neon node the same \"native\" feel. I also made one early call: go modular. It's tempting to cram everything into a single file, but Neon workflows can get hairy fast, and n8n's mental model is all about consistency. Every database node should feel familiar, so I leaned into that.\n\nIn the n8n ecosystem, the recommended file structure is this:\n\n- **actions/** → sub-directories for each resource. Each contains:\n  - a resource description file (`<resourceName>.resource.ts` or `index.ts`)\n  - one file per operation (`<operationName>.operation.ts`), each exporting both the operation's description and its execute function\n- **methods/** → optional, for dynamic parameter functions\n- **transport/** → handles the actual communication layer (API calls, DB connections, etc.)\n\nWith that mental model in mind, here's how my Neon node structure shaped up:\n\n```\nnodes/Neon/\n├── actions/operations/\n│   ├── executeQuery.operation.ts\n│   ├── insert.operation.ts\n│   ├── select.operation.ts\n│   ├── update.operation.ts\n│   └── delete.operation.ts\n├── helpers/\n│   ├── utils.ts\n│   └── interface.ts\n└── methods/\n    ├── credentialTest.ts\n    ├── listSearch.ts\n    └── resourceMapping.ts\n```\n\nThis separation of concerns made the whole thing more maintainable, and way easier for me to reason about.\n\nSo basically, an n8n node is a single class in the main TypeScript file. That class acts as the entry point, the hub where credentials, operations, and helper methods all plug in. Mine looked something like this:\n\n```typescript\nimport type {\n  IExecuteFunctions,\n  INodeType,\n  INodeTypeDescription,\n} from 'n8n-workflow';\n\nimport * as operations from './actions/operations';\nimport { listSearch, credentialTest, resourceMapping } from './methods';\n\nexport class Neon implements INodeType {\n  description: INodeTypeDescription = {\n    displayName: 'Neon',\n    name: 'neon',\n    icon: 'file:neon.svg',\n    group: ['input'],\n    version: 1,\n    subtitle: '={{ $parameter[\"operation\"] }}',\n    description: 'Interact with Neon Database',\n    defaults: { name: 'Neon' },\n    inputs: ['main'],\n    outputs: ['main'],\n    credentials: [\n      {\n        name: 'neonApi',\n        required: true,\n        testedBy: 'neonCredentialTest',\n      },\n    ],\n    properties: [\n      // Resource and operation definitions\n    ],\n  };\n\n  methods = {\n    credentialTest: { neonCredentialTest: credentialTest },\n    listSearch,\n    resourceMapping,\n  };\n\n  async execute(this: IExecuteFunctions) {\n    // Route to appropriate operation\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Mapping Modes: Auto vs Manual\n\nWhen inserting data, I wanted to support two mapping modes:\n\n- **Auto-Map Input Data to Columns** → n8n maps the incoming JSON object directly to table columns. Perfect if the JSON keys from the previous node match the column names in the Neon database\n- **Manual Map (Define Values Below)** → if keys don't match, the user will pick each column and set its value themselves. More tedious, but gives full control.\n\nHere is an example of the INSERT operation config:\n\n```typescript\nconst properties: INodeProperties[] = [\n  // Data to send for insert operations\n  {\n    displayName: 'Map Column Mode',\n    name: 'mappingMode',\n    type: 'options',\n    options: [\n      {\n        name: 'Auto-Map Input Data to Columns',\n        value: 'autoMapInputData',\n        description: 'Use when node input properties names exactly match the neon column names',\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'Map Each Column Manually',\n        value: 'defineBelow',\n        description: 'Set the value for each destination column manually',\n      },\n    ],\n    default: 'autoMapInputData',\n    description:\n      'Whether to map node input properties and the table data automatically or manually',\n    displayOptions: {\n      show: {\n        resource: ['row'],\n        operation: ['insert'],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  {\n    displayName: 'Values to Send',\n    name: 'valuesToSend',\n    placeholder: 'Add Value',\n    type: 'fixedCollection',\n    typeOptions: {\n      multipleValueButtonText: 'Add Value',\n      multipleValues: true,\n    },\n    displayOptions: {\n      show: {\n        mappingMode: ['defineBelow'],\n      },\n    },\n    default: {},\n    options: [\n      {\n        displayName: 'Values',\n        name: 'values',\n        values: [\n          {\n            displayName: 'Column',\n            name: 'column',\n            type: 'options',\n            description:\n              'Choose from the list, or specify an ID using an expression',\n            typeOptions: {\n              loadOptionsMethod: 'getTableColumns',\n              loadOptionsDependsOn: ['schema', 'table'],\n            },\n            default: '',\n          },\n          {\n            displayName: 'Value',\n            name: 'value',\n            type: 'string',\n            default: '',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  optionsCollection\n];\n\nconst displayOptions = {\n  show: {\n    resource: ['row'],\n    operation: ['insert'],\n  },\n  hide: {\n    table: [''],\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIf the user selects manual mode, they see a **\"Values to Send\"** field where they can pick columns and provide values one by one. Behind the scenes, I had to normalise data from both modes into the same object structure before building the SQL query. Otherwise, I had to deal with unstable data formats.\n\nThe catch? Not every input object matched the actual table schema. That led to confusing errors where inserts would silently fail. So before building the query, I pulled the schema directly from the database and cross-checked it with the input object. If any mismatch is found, I stop execution early.\n\n### Execute Operation: The Pain Hole\n\nThe INSERT operation was straightforward; EXECUTE was the tricky one. On the surface, the interface need is simple: a SQL editor for the raw query, plus a field for query parameters. A user could type something like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {{ $json.userId }}\n```\n\nLooks fine, but here's the catch—**n8n expressions (`{{ $json.userId }}`) aren't plain strings**. They're dynamic placeholders. I passed them straight into my query, and Neon kept throwing errors.\n\nThe fix was small but critical. I looped through the query, found all expressions, and resolved them before execution:\n\n```typescript\nfor (const resolvable of getExpressions(query)) {\n  query = query.replace(\n    resolvable,\n    this.evaluateExpression(resolvable, index) as string\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWorked!!! As expected, I just had to play nicely with the queries.\n\n### SELECT Operation: Condition and Sorting\n\nThe SELECT operation felt trickier, but needed more thinking around it. The goal was to let users fetch rows with **filters, conditions, and sort results**.\n\nSo the interface need was clear:\n\n1. **Select Rows** → A fixed collection where users pick a column, an operator (`=`, `>`, `<`, etc.), and a value. Example: _Column = age, Operator = >, Value = 18._\n2. **Combine Conditions** → A simple dropdown: `AND` or `OR`. This lets users build compound filters.\n3. **Sort** → A collection field where users choose a column and direction (`ASC` or `DESC`).\n\nBehind the scenes, I build a WHERE clause with these input values before proceeding to add it to the final query to be executed. For example:\n\n- User config → `{ column: 'age', operator: '>', value: 18 }`\n- Values → `['age', 18]`\n\nHere's the built WHERE clause:\n\n```sql\nWHERE $0:name > $1 AND $2:name = $3\n```\n\nThis pattern made SELECT operations safe. Users could stack conditions, combine them, and sort results without writing queries themselves.\n\n### UPDATE and DELETE Operations\n\nOnce INSERT and SELECT were working, **UPDATE** and **DELETE** felt much easier. The patterns were already in place:\n\n- Users will specify conditions the same way as SELECT.\n- For UPDATE, they will choose which columns to modify and what the new values should be.\n- For DELETE, they will choose to drop the whole table, truncate all the table data, or just delete rows that match the filter conditions.\n\nBy this point, the heavy lifting was done. Most of the work was making sure inputs were validated against the Neon schema and queries were parameterised for safety.\n\n## Challenges and Moving Forward\n\nLooking back, one of the earliest decisions that saved me countless headaches was sticking with **parameterised queries**. Raw SQL feels more straightforward, especially when you're building complex conditions, but parameterisation gave me two wins at once: protection against injection and a consistent way to construct queries programmatically. `pg-promise` made this possible, to use syntax like `$1:name` or `$2:name`, with this everything became smoother.\n\nAnother key choice for me was leaning on **n8n's conventions**. Their documentation and official node patterns became my guardrails. Any time I drifted too far from those patterns, things broke. In n8n, conventions aren't optional.\n\nThe irony? I spent more time researching, planning, and translating Neon requirements into n8n's mental model than actually writing code. The hardest part of building a custom node isn't SQL or TypeScript, it's learning how to translate the platform's needs into something that fits seamlessly into n8n's conventions.\n\nThe fact that almost any custom node you can imagine is buildable in just a few weeks is wild — the custom node came together in such a short time, and it blew my mind.\n\nThe code lives on GitHub. Fork it, run it, break it, fix it. 🚀\n\n","fields":{"slug":"/articles/2025/n8n-node/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/portfolio-site/portfolio-site/src/posts/2025/n8n-node/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I Built an n8n Community Node for Neon Database","summary":"Building a custom n8n community node for Neon database that supports CRUD operations, branch switching, and follows n8n's conventions with parameterized queries for security.","date":"07 September, 2025","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/portfolio-site/static/a4cbb2e25fa0cd1a5f495747e6a97de3/1ad5b/01-cover.webp","srcSet":"/portfolio-site/static/a4cbb2e25fa0cd1a5f495747e6a97de3/c29f3/01-cover.webp 750w,\n/portfolio-site/static/a4cbb2e25fa0cd1a5f495747e6a97de3/1ad5b/01-cover.webp 1000w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/articles/2025/n8n-node/","frontmatter":{"title":"How I Built an n8n Community Node for Neon Database","summary":"Building a custom n8n community node for Neon database that supports CRUD operations, branch switching, and follows n8n's conventions with parameterized queries for security.","cover":"assets/01-cover.webp","date":"2025-09-07T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
